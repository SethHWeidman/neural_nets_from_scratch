# neural_nets_from_scratch

This work-in-progress repo will be a neural net library designed for understanding the math behind why neural nets work.

## How to navigate

The code uploaded so far is designed to supplement the series of blog posts on neural nets posted at [my website](http://sethweidman.com).

Start by reading the [first neural net post](http://sethweidman.com/neural_net_post); the code accompanying is in the `lesson_1.py` file.

Then, continue by reading the [second](http://sethweidman.com/neural_net_post_2) and [third](http://sethweidman.com/neural_net_post_3) posts; the code accompanying these posts is in the `lesson_2.py` and `lesson_3.py` files.

## Other resources

The `Multi-Layer Neural Net Using Classes to Learn MNIST.ipynb` file represents the limits of the neural net tutorials I've written so far. It illustrates how this mathematically-based neural net framework can be extended to learn a neural net with high accuracy on the MNIST data.

## Next Steps

The next short-term step is to write a blog post completing the class-based neural net framework in the code above. 

The next long-term step is to extend this framework to implement convolutional layers, rather than just fully connected layers as it does now.
