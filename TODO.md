# TODO

Need to organize things

# Features implemented

Step one: I need to combine the features that are currently in two different
places into one common place.

## Features in `neural_net.py` but not the talk


## Basic features in neither

* Num epochs
* Different activation functions
* Normalization - normal
* Normalization - softmax

## Advanced features in neither
* Nesterov momentum
* Changing design so each layer just defines a number of neurons
